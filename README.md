This repository contains files for a project I proposed during my participation in Fall 2024 Erdos Data Scinece Bootcamp.
In this project we use car sales data from CarDekho.com, which is an online marketplace that helps people buy and sell cars in India.
We use different car features to predict sales price.
There are four other Erdos bootcamp members that work on this project in the same group with me. 
While this repository contains my analysis,
the analysis of all group members can be found in the following collaborative github repository https://github.com/parabamoghv/Erdos-AU2024-CarSalesPricePrediction



# Modeling the relationship between car sales price and different car features

Buying and selling cars is common experience especially among people leaving in rural areas with little or no transportation.
It is thus interesting to study what factors do influence car sales price significantly and what can be improved to have better sales and fair car sales prices.
Using differnt Machine Learning Regression methods we will develop models to predict car sales price using [CarDekho Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho/data?select=Car+details+v3.csv) .
